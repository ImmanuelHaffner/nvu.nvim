--- nvu.edit.anchors.modifier — resolver for positional modifier anchors.
---
--- Modifiers resolve to a **zero-width position** consumed by `insert`
--- ops — `replace_range` and `delete_range` need ranges, not positions,
--- and the schema rejects modifier-wrapped anchors on those op kinds.
---
--- ## The three modifiers
---
--- | Modifier  | Wraps                     | Position                                   |
--- |-----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
--- | `before`  | a base anchor `of`        | the seam *above* the base span (before S)  |
--- | `after`   | a base anchor `of`        | the seam *below* the base span (after E)   |
--- | `between` | two texts before/after_text | the seam *between* the two adjacent texts |
---
--- `before`/`after` pin to the **outer** edges of the span their base
--- anchor resolves to: `before` → before its first line, `after` → after
--- its last line. The span is matched purely to be unique; the seam is
--- always one of its two outer faces.
---
--- `between` exists for the case `before`/`after` cannot express: a seam
--- whose disambiguating context straddles it — some lines *above* the
--- insertion point and the line that makes the location unique *below*
--- it (or vice versa). You name the two sides directly: `before_text` is
--- the text immediately before the seam, `after_text` the text immediately
--- after. The engine matches `before_text .. "\n" .. after_text` as a
--- single contiguous block (so the *concatenation* must be unique, not
--- either side alone) and places the seam at the join. This reuses the
--- `unique_text` matcher verbatim, so `between` inherits its
--- `anchor_not_found` / `anchor_ambiguous` reporting (with candidates) for
--- free.
---
--- ## The zero-width convention
---
--- A range with `end_line = start_line - 1` is a **zero-width position**:
--- nothing is replaced; new content is inserted at `start_line` and
--- existing content from `start_line` onward shifts down. This maps
--- directly to `nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, start_0, start_0, false, lines)`
--- (start and end indices equal — pure insertion).
---
--- ## Multi-range bases (`occurrence: "all"`)
---
--- The schema allows `before`/`after` to wrap a `unique_text` with
--- `occurrence: "all"`, but the semantics of "insert before every match"
--- are not part of MVP — `insert` ops resolve to a single position. If
--- the base resolver returns the multi-range shape `{ranges = {...}}`,
--- this resolver fails with an invariant assertion. (Real-world demand
--- for multi-position inserts can lift this later; the failure mode for
--- now is "schema accepts, planner refuses".)

--- Dispatch a base anchor to the right resolver.

--- lives in `nvu.edit.anchors`. Duplicating the two-line table here keeps
--- the modifier module self-contained and avoids a require cycle.
