--- nvu.edit.anchors.line_range — resolver for the `line_range` anchor kind.
---
--- Trivial by design: the schema has already validated that `start` and
--- `end_` are positive integers with `end_ >= start`. The resolver's only
--- job is to bounds-check against the actual file's line count and emit a
--- structured `anchor_not_found` failure if either endpoint is past EOF.
---
--- Why a separate resolver for the trivial case? Two reasons:
---   1. Uniform interface: every anchor kind exposes `M.resolve(anchor,
---      record)` returning the same `(range, nil) | (nil, failure)` shape,
---      so the planner can dispatch without case analysis on the failure
---      reason.
---   2. The bounds check belongs in the planner phase, not the schema. The
---      schema runs before any file is read; it cannot know `n_lines`.

--- The shape a resolver returns on success: a single resolved range.
--- @class nvu.edit.ResolvedRange
--- @field start_line integer 1-based, inclusive.
--- @field end_line   integer 1-based, inclusive, >= start_line.

--- The shape a resolver returns on failure. Echoes the parsed anchor back
--- to the LLM together with a structured reason and an actionable hint.
--- The planner enriches this with `op_index` and `path` before surfacing it
--- in the response.
--- @class nvu.edit.AnchorFailure
--- @field reason          string                   See schema.ERROR_REASONS.
--- @field anchor          table                    The parsed anchor that failed to resolve.
--- @field hint            string                   What the LLM should do next.
--- @field available_range table?                   `{ start_line = 1, end_line = n_lines }` for out-of-bounds reports.
--- @field candidates      nvu.edit.ResolvedRange[]? Used by `unique_text`; absent for `line_range`.
--- @field total_matches   (integer|string)?         Used by `unique_text`; absent for `line_range`.

--- Resolve a `line_range` anchor against a file record.
---
--- @param anchor table                Validated anchor: `{ by = 'line_range', start = N, end = M }`.
---                                    (Field is `end_` after schema's reserved-word rewrite — see note.)
--- @param record nvu.edit.FileRecord
--- @return nvu.edit.ResolvedRange|nil range  On success.
--- @return nvu.edit.AnchorFailure|nil failure  On failure.
