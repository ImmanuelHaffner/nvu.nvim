--- nvu.edit.anchors.unique_text — resolver for the `unique_text` anchor kind.
---
--- Locates anchor positions by **plain-text substring match** (no Lua
--- patterns, no regex). The default policy is "must be unique": if the
--- text occurs more than once and no `occurrence` was specified, the
--- resolver returns a structured `anchor_ambiguous` failure with up to
--- three candidate locations so the LLM can refine its query or pick by
--- `occurrence.nth`.
---
--- ## Why plain text, not patterns
---
--- The LLM emits anchor text as a verbatim slice of the file. Pattern
--- interpretation would silently treat metacharacters (`.` `*` `(` `[`
--- `%` etc.) as regex syntax — sometimes matching what the LLM intended,
--- sometimes not, with no obvious way to debug. Plain-text matching gives
--- one rule the LLM can rely on: "the bytes you sent must match the bytes
--- in the file."
---
--- ## Candidate cap (locked: 3)
---
--- When the text matches >1 location and no disambiguator was given, we
--- return up to **3** candidate ranges, sorted ascending by `start_line`.
--- The resolver early-exits after finding `cap + 1 = 4` matches — we need
--- exactly one beyond the cap to know "more exist" without paying for a
--- full scan. The failure reports `total_matches` as the integer count
--- when bounded, or the string `">3"` when unbounded.
---
--- Smaller cap means smaller failure-response payloads and less LLM
--- context bloat; the LLM should refine its query rather than scan a list
--- of candidates.
---
--- ## Non-overlapping matches
---
--- Searching `"aa"` in `"aaaa"` finds positions 1 and 3 (two matches),
--- not 1, 2, 3 (three overlapping). Matches the convention of every
--- text-editing tool (`:s///g`, `sed -e`, etc.) and avoids the
--- combinatorial explosion of "find all overlapping copies of a pattern"
--- — which is rarely what an LLM editing code actually wants.
---
--- ## Multi-line matches
---
--- The anchor text may contain `\n`. The byte→line translation handles
--- this transparently: the match's start byte and end byte are each
--- translated independently via `file_record.byte_to_line`, yielding a
--- multi-line `{start_line, end_line}` range.
