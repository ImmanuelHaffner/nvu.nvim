--- nvu.edit — structured, batch-atomic file-edit engine.
---
--- The pure engine behind the MCP tool `neovim__apply_edit`. Deliberately
--- client-agnostic: no mcphub, no LLM, no MCP, no UI imports. Inputs are
--- typed Lua tables; outputs are typed Lua tables. The mcphub adapter at
--- `lua/mcphub/_native/edit/init.lua` is the only file that bridges this
--- engine to the MCP world.

--- Render a list of schema errors as `failed[]` entries in the canonical
--- response shape. Each error becomes one entry with `reason = "schema_invalid"`
--- and the structured field details promoted to top-level keys.

    local failed = {}

        table.insert(failed, {

            reason   = 'schema_invalid',
            path     = e.path,

--- Forward planner failures as `failed[]` entries. Each planner failure
--- already carries `reason` (from `schema.ERROR_REASONS`), `op_index`,
--- `path`, and reason-specific fields (`candidates`, `live_fingerprint`,
--- `live_content`, etc.); we pass them through verbatim.

--- Apply a batch of edit operations.
---
--- ## LLM-facing seal (architectural invariant)
---
--- This function is the engine's **single LLM-facing entry point**. The
--- mcphub adapter calls it with the raw decoded request, a driver
--- callback, and a completion callback — nothing else. It deliberately
--- takes **no opts table**: the internal modules below this function
--- (`schema.validate`, `planner.plan`) accept opts including
--- `bypass_fingerprint = true` for test isolation, and threading that
--- through here would expose a production-side relaxation path. Keeping
--- `M.apply` opts-free is what makes "the LLM cannot bypass fingerprint
--- enforcement" a structural property rather than a code-review property.
---
--- `drive_file` and `on_complete` are continuations, not configuration —
--- they're caller-provided callable channels, not opts. They cannot be
--- expressed in the MCP tool's JSON Schema (which is the LLM-facing
--- surface), so an LLM cannot reach them.
---
--- ## Async by design
---
--- `M.apply` returns nothing. The response is delivered to `on_complete`
--- once the planner-or-applier phase finishes. Schema-only failures fire
--- `on_complete` synchronously from within `M.apply`; planner / applier
--- paths fire it from `vim.schedule` contexts. Callers needing
--- synchronous semantics `vim.wait(...)` on a flag set by `on_complete`.
---
--- @param input       table        Decoded request body (raw, untyped — validation happens here).
--- @param drive_file  fun(req: nvu.edit.applier.FileRequest, file_cb: fun(o: nvu.edit.applier.FileOutcome))
---                    The per-file driver. Conforms to the contract documented in
---                    `nvu.edit.applier.apply_plan`. Production callers pass
---                    `mcphub._native.edit.ui_backend.drive_file`; tests pass
---                    `tests.edit.drivers.accept_all` (or another synthetic backend).
--- @param on_complete fun(response: table)  Delivers the structured response.
