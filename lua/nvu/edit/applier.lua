--- nvu.edit.applier — execute a planner Plan, one file at a time.
---
--- The applier is the final phase of `apply_edit`:
---
---   1. Schema   →  parsed_input
---   2. Planner  →  Plan { located_ops, records, warnings }
---   3. Applier (this module) → response { applied[], rejected[], failed[], ... }
---
--- ## What this module does
---
---   * Groups `plan.located_ops` by path, preserving op order.
---   * Sequences files: drives one file at a time, awaiting each file's
---     outcome before starting the next.
---   * Classifies per-file outcomes into `applied[]` / `rejected[]` entries
---     in the response.
---   * Implements cancel semantics: if any file is cancelled, remaining
---     files' ops are emitted as `not_attempted` failures.
---   * Composes the final structured response and delivers it via `on_done`.
---
--- ## What this module does NOT do
---
--- This module never touches a buffer, opens a window, talks to mcphub, or
--- knows about `EditUI`. It is pure plan-execution logic over Lua tables.
--- The actual buffer mutation + per-hunk review UI is delegated to a
--- caller-provided `drive_file` callback (see the `apply_plan` docstring
--- for its call contract).
---
--- This keeps `nvu.edit` usable as a library by any caller that wants
--- structured anchor-based edits: the default integration is mcphub's
--- `EditUI`, but tests can pass a synthetic `drive_file` that applies edits
--- non-interactively, and future callers (CLI batch mode, Telescope
--- workflow, etc.) can supply their own driver.
---
--- ## Async by design
---
--- The driver of choice — mcphub's `EditUI` — is callback-driven (delivers
--- its outcome via `vim.schedule`). `apply_plan` is therefore async: the
--- response is delivered via `on_done`, never returned. Tests `vim.wait(...)`
--- on a local flag set by `on_done`.
---
--- ## Sequential per file
---
--- Files are driven one at a time. This is non-negotiable for the mcphub
--- backend (`EditUI` installs global keymaps for its duration; two
--- simultaneous instances would conflict). Synthetic test backends are
--- free to ignore the sequencing — they'll just see one `drive_file` call
--- finish before the next starts.
---
--- Cross-file atomicity is therefore best-effort: a user rejecting file B
--- cannot roll back the write already accepted on file A. Earlier design
--- sketches with tmpfile + rename promised cross-file atomicity but were
--- incompatible with reusing `EditUI`. The response shape reflects reality
--- (`applied[]` and `rejected[]` per op).
---
--- @module "nvu.edit.applier"

--- One unit of work for `drive_file`: a single (op_index, range) pair, with
--- the bytes that should replace the range. Pure data — no mcphub or UI
--- types. For `delete_range + occurrence:"all"`, a single planner op
--- produces multiple blocks, one per resolved range.
--- @class nvu.edit.applier.Block
--- @field block_id      string       Stable id of the form "opN_rM".
--- @field op_index      integer      1-based Lua op index from the parsed input.
--- @field kind          string       'replace_range' | 'insert' | 'delete_range'.
--- @field range         { start_line: integer, end_line: integer }  1-based inclusive; insertion is { N, N-1 }.
--- @field replace_lines string[]     Bytes to insert; `{}` for `delete_range`.

--- Per-file request passed to `drive_file`.
--- @class nvu.edit.applier.FileRequest
--- @field file_path        string
--- @field bufnr            integer
--- @field original_content string
--- @field blocks           nvu.edit.applier.Block[]
--- @field interactive      boolean

--- Per-file outcome delivered by `drive_file` via its `file_cb`.
---
--- ## Statuses
---
---   * `'completed'` — `drive_file` ran the batch and `per_block` describes
---     the per-block acceptance. Any blocks absent from `per_block` are
---     treated as accepted.
---   * `'cancelled'` — the user closed the editor partway. `per_block`
---     may carry partial results; absent blocks are treated as cancelled
---     (surfaced as `rejected[]` with `reason='cancelled'`). Subsequent
---     files in the batch are not attempted.
---   * `'no_changes'` — driver had nothing to apply (e.g. no blocks).
---   * `'precondition_failed'` — the driver refused to run the batch
---     because of a structural limitation that would otherwise produce
---     a wrong result. `failures[]` describes the offending ops; every
---     block in this file is surfaced as `failed[]`, no blocks are
---     surfaced as `applied[]` or `rejected[]`. The batch continues
---     with subsequent files (this is a per-file refusal, not a
---     batch-level cancel).
---
--- @class nvu.edit.applier.FileOutcome
--- @field status        string          'completed' | 'cancelled' | 'no_changes' | 'precondition_failed'
--- @field cancel_reason string?         Present on cancelled.
--- @field per_block     table<string, string>?  block_id → 'accepted' | 'rejected' | 'partial' | 'skipped'.
--- @field failures      table[]?        Present on precondition_failed. Each entry
---                                       carries at minimum `{ op_index, reason, message }`
---                                       and may carry reason-specific extras (e.g. `range`,
---                                       `conflicting_op_indices`). Driver-supplied.
--- @field ui_summary    string?         Free-form per-file summary for the LLM.
--- @field diagnostics   nvu.edit.Diagnostic[]?  Structured LSP diagnostics **near the
---                                       edit** — those intersecting an edited range
---                                       ± a context window (driver's choice; the
---                                       mcphub backend uses ±10 lines). All severities.
---                                       Driver-supplied; absent means "not collected".
---                                       An empty array means "collected, nothing to
---                                       report near the edit". This is intentionally
---                                       NOT the whole-file set — see `diagnostic_counts`
---                                       for the file-wide tally. See `nvu.edit.Diagnostic`.
--- @field diagnostic_counts nvu.edit.DiagnosticCounts?  Whole-file tally of errors and
---                                       warnings (info/hint excluded as too chatty).
---                                       Driver-supplied; absent means "not collected".
---                                       Lets the LLM orient ("the file has N errors")
---                                       without serialising every one.
---
--- A single LSP-style diagnostic, normalised for LLM consumption.
---
--- The shape is intentionally a strict subset of `vim.diagnostic.Diagnostic`,
--- with positions translated from Neovim's 0-based to our project-wide
--- 1-based convention and severity rendered as a stable lowercase string
--- rather than the integer enum. Driver-supplied: the applier never
--- introspects these.
