--- nvu.edit.fingerprint — content-derived identifiers for the
--- read-then-edit race guard.
---
--- A baseline fingerprint is the LLM's receipt that it has read a file
--- and is planning edits against a specific revision of its content.
--- Every op in `apply_edit` carries a `baseline_fingerprint` field
--- pointing at a fingerprint previously issued by
--- `neovim__read_with_fingerprint`; the planner recomputes the
--- fingerprint over the live file at apply time and refuses the batch
--- on mismatch (`stale_fingerprint`). This is what closes the
--- inter-batch race: between the LLM's read and its subsequent edit,
--- the file may have been mutated by the user or another tool, and
--- anchors planned against the stale content would otherwise land at
--- the wrong location silently.
---
--- ## Format
---
--- A bare 7-character lowercase-hex string — the first 7 hex characters
--- of `vim.fn.sha256(content)`. Example: `a3f9d2c`.
---
---   * 7 hex chars = 28 bits ≈ 268M values. The fingerprint is compared
---     **pairwise per file per batch** (not searched across a
---     population), so the relevant collision probability is
---     ~1 / 2²⁸ ≈ 3.7×10⁻⁹ per comparison. The failure mode if a
---     collision did occur is "we accept a stale fingerprint and apply
---     edits anchored against shifted content" — the same failure mode
---     `apply_edit` has today without fingerprints, so the collision
---     cost is bounded by the pre-existing baseline.
---   * The LLM treats it as opaque: do not parse, do not regenerate.
---     Pass it through verbatim from `neovim__read_with_fingerprint`
---     into `apply_edit`.
---
--- ## Hash primitive
---
--- `vim.fn.sha256`, built into Neovim. We are not defending against
--- adversaries — only detecting honest mutation — so cryptographic
--- strength is irrelevant; uniform-length hex output and zero
--- dependencies are what we want. The word "fingerprint" (over "hash")
--- in the public vocabulary intentionally hides this implementation
--- detail; we are free to change the primitive without churning the
--- protocol.
---
--- ## Input to the hash
---
--- The buffer-normalised content from `FileRecord.content` —
--- `nvim_buf_get_lines` joined with `\n`, plus a trailing `\n` iff
--- `vim.bo[bufnr].endofline`. This is the same byte sequence both
--- `read_with_fingerprint` (token emission) and the planner
--- (`stale_fingerprint` validation) feed into the hash, so the
--- comparison is meaningful as long as the buffer hasn't changed. See
--- `file_record.lua` for the EOL-normalisation routine.

    return vim.fn.sha256(content):sub(1, M.LEN)
end

--- Test whether a fingerprint matches some content's current
--- fingerprint.
---
--- Used by the planner to detect `stale_fingerprint` — the per-op
--- `baseline_fingerprint` field from the request is compared against
--- the live buffer's content via this function.

--- Validate that a string has the shape of a fingerprint: exactly
--- `LEN` lowercase-hex characters.
---
--- Used by input validation (and by tests) to give a clear error
--- before the planner tries to compare a malformed value.
--- `vim.fn.sha256` emits lowercase hex, so we don't accept uppercase:
--- any fingerprint that could have come from `compute()` is lowercase
--- by construction.
