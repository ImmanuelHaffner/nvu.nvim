--- nvu.edit.read — the engine behind `neovim__read_with_fingerprint`.
---
--- One function — `M.read_with_fingerprint(path, opts)` — that
--- buffer-loads a file (via `FileRecord.read`, the same buffer-first
--- pipeline the planner uses), computes a baseline fingerprint over
--- its whole content (via `nvu.edit.fingerprint`), and returns both —
--- optionally restricting the returned `content` to a line range.
---
--- The LLM then carries the fingerprint verbatim on every `apply_edit`
--- op against that file (in the op's `baseline_fingerprint` field); the
--- planner re-computes and refuses the batch on mismatch.
---
--- ## Why this exists
---
--- Without fingerprints, an LLM that read a file at t0 and called
--- `apply_edit` at t2 against anchors planned against t0's content
--- has no way to detect that the file mutated at t1. Anchors may
--- resolve to the wrong location silently. With required fingerprints,
--- the planner detects the drift and aborts with `stale_fingerprint`.
---
--- This is the **canonical** read path for text files. The legacy
--- `neovim__read_file` is removed from the LLM-facing surface (by
--- user-side mcphub config) so every edit is anchored against a known
--- baseline. There is no bypass.
---
--- ## Range projection (`start_line` / `end_line`)
---
--- Both fields are optional, 1-based, inclusive — matching the rest of
--- the engine's range convention. `start_line` defaults to 1; `end_line`
--- defaults to the file's total line count.
---
--- The fingerprint is **always** computed over the whole file regardless
--- of the range. This is load-bearing: if `apply_edit` re-fingerprints
--- the whole buffer at apply time (which it does), a range-scoped
--- fingerprint would always mismatch. The range is purely a content
--- projection knob on the response.
---
--- ### Edge-case policy
---
--- * `end_line > total_lines` — silently clamped to `total_lines`. This
---   is the common "read from line N to end" pattern with a deliberately-
---   large `end_line` (e.g. 99999); clamping is the right default.
--- * `start_line > total_lines` — refused with `start_after_eof`. This
---   indicates the LLM held a stale view of the file's length and the
---   request is recoverable in one round-trip by reading without a
---   `start_line` first to discover `total_lines`.
--- * `start_line > end_line` (both **explicitly** provided) — refused
---   with `invalid_range`. Malformed pair; not a state mismatch. When
---   only `start_line` is provided and it happens to exceed the engine's
---   `total_lines` default for `end_line`, `start_after_eof` is the
---   reported reason — the user did not actually provide a backwards
---   range.
--- * Both omitted — behaviour identical to a whole-file read.
---
--- ## What it returns
---
--- Success:
---   { status               = 'ok',
---     path                 = '<absolute path>',
---     content              = '<projected bytes>',     -- the range, or whole file
---     baseline_fingerprint = '<7-hex chars>',         -- ALWAYS whole-file
---     start_line           = N,                       -- echoed, clamped to bounds
---     end_line             = M,                       -- echoed, clamped to bounds
---     returned_lines       = M - N + 1,               -- lines in `content`
---     total_lines          = K }                      -- whole-file line count
---
--- Failure:
---   { status   = 'failed',
---     summary  = '<one-line summary>',
---     failed   = { { reason, path, message, hint, ... } } }
---
--- The failure shape mirrors `apply_edit`'s `failed[]` entries so the
--- LLM sees a uniform error structure across both tools.
