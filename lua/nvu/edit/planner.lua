--- nvu.edit.planner — orchestrate file reads + anchor resolution + conflict detection.
---
--- The planner is the read-only middle phase of `apply_edit`:
---
---   1. Schema (`schema.lua`)   →  validated `parsed_input`  →
---   2. Planner (this module)   →  located ops + records      →
---   3. Applier (later)         →  buffer mutations + review UI.
---
--- The planner never writes to a buffer or to disk. It only reads files
--- (via `file_record.read` — buffer-first; see `file_record.lua`),
--- resolves anchors (via `anchors.resolve`), and detects cross-op range
--- conflicts within the same batch.
---
--- ## Output shape
---
--- On success, returns a `Plan`:
---   {
---     located_ops = LocatedOp[],
---     records     = { [abs_path] = FileRecord },
---     warnings    = Warning[],            -- forwarded from schema + planner-added
---   }
---
--- where each `LocatedOp` is:
---   {
---     op_index = 1-based integer (Lua-native; matches parsed_input.ops[op_index]),
---     kind     = 'replace_range' | 'insert' | 'delete_range',
---     path     = absolute path (matches a key in records),
---     range    = { start_line, end_line }            -- single-range case
---     ranges   = { ResolvedRange, ... }              -- only for delete_range + occurrence:"all"
---     content  = string?                              -- resolved content for replace/insert
---     indent   = 'match_anchor' | 'preserve' | 'detect',
---   }
---
--- `range` and `ranges` are mutually exclusive — exactly one is present.
---
--- On failure, returns `(nil, { failures = Failure[], warnings = Warning[] })`.
--- Failures are per-op; the planner accumulates all of them before
--- returning, so the LLM sees every problem in one round-trip rather
--- than fixing one at a time.
---
--- ## Range conflict semantics (MVP, conservative)
---
--- Two ops in the same file conflict iff their **inclusive line sets**
--- intersect. The line set of a range `[s, e]` is `{s, s+1, ..., e}`;
--- for a zero-width position `[s, s-1]` (an insertion) the line set is
--- `{s}` — i.e. the insertion is treated as "touching the line it sits
--- before".
---
--- This rule is conservative: it flags some technically-safe edits as
--- conflicts (e.g. `replace_range [3..5]` plus `insert after line 5`
--- would be flagged because both touch line 5, even though the insert
--- actually places content between lines 5 and 6). Conservative is the
--- right call for MVP — false positives are clear errors the LLM can
--- fix by reordering or splitting into two batches; false negatives
--- would be silent corruption. Relax later if real usage shows the rule
--- is too restrictive.
---
--- ## Fingerprint validation
---
--- For each op, the planner computes the live file's fingerprint and
--- compares it against `op.baseline_fingerprint`. Mismatch produces a
--- `stale_fingerprint` failure carrying both the live fingerprint and
--- the content, so the LLM can replan in its next turn without an
--- extra read round-trip. The check runs between `read_files` and
--- `resolve_anchors` because there's no point resolving anchors
--- against bytes the LLM didn't see.
---
--- The check is gated on `opts.bypass_fingerprint`. When true (a
--- test-only bypass), the planner skips the fingerprint phase entirely
--- — useful for spec files that exercise anchor / conflict logic
--- without threading synthetic fingerprints. The bypass is per-call
--- and never reaches `nvu.edit.apply(input)`, the LLM-facing seal.
---
--- @module "nvu.edit.planner"

--- ## Indexing convention
---
--- `op_index` everywhere in this module is **1-based Lua-native** —
--- the same `op_index` you'd use as `parsed_input.ops[op_index]`. The
--- 0-based JSON form is produced only by `response.lua` when emitting
--- the wire output. See `schema.lua`'s header for the load-bearing
--- rationale.
