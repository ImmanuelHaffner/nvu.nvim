--- nvu.edit.json — UTF-8-safe JSON encoding for tool responses.
---
--- The MCP tool handlers (`apply_edit`, `read_with_fingerprint`) encode
--- their response table to a JSON string and hand it back to mcphub →
--- CodeCompanion → the LLM provider. That string travels, verbatim,
--- into the provider's request body on the *next* HTTP submit.
---
--- ## The bug this module exists to prevent
---
--- Neovim's `vim.json.encode` is **lenient about UTF-8**: it copies raw
--- string bytes into the JSON output without validating that they form
--- well-formed UTF-8. In particular, a byte sequence that decodes to a
--- UTF-16 *surrogate* code point (U+D800–U+DFFF), which shows up in the
--- wild as WTF-8 / CESU-8 encoded text (bytes `0xED 0xA0..0xBF
--- 0x80..0xBF`), is passed straight through unescaped.
---
--- Our responses echo file content back to the LLM — anchor candidates,
--- surrounding-context snippets, rejected-hunk previews, error
--- `message`/`hint` fields. If the edited file contains such bytes
--- (common with Java/Windows-origin text, CESU-8 data, or corrupted
--- UTF-8), they end up verbatim inside a JSON string.
---
--- `vim.json.encode` does **not** raise on this — it returns a string
--- and reports success — so a `pcall` guard around it is useless. The
--- failure is *deferred*: the poisoned tool result is stored in the chat
--- history, and only when the provider's strict JSON parser (e.g.
--- Anthropic's `serde_json`) receives the next request does it reject
--- the whole body with:
---
---   The request body is not valid JSON: str is not valid UTF-8:
---   surrogates not allowed
---
--- Once poisoned, *every* subsequent turn in that chat fails until the
--- offending message is removed. The symptom looks like "apply_edit
--- broke the chat" even though apply_edit itself returned fine.
---
--- ## The fix
---
--- Before encoding, recursively scrub every string in the response to
--- well-formed UTF-8, replacing each byte that is not part of a valid
--- UTF-8 sequence with the Unicode replacement character U+FFFD (`�`,
--- bytes `EF BF BD`). Valid UTF-8 — ASCII, accented Latin, CJK, emoji
--- and other astral-plane characters — passes through byte-for-byte
--- untouched; only genuinely malformed bytes (surrogate encodings,
--- overlong forms, stray continuation bytes, truncated sequences) are
--- replaced.
---
--- `M.safe_encode` bundles "scrub then encode" so both handlers get the
--- fix through one tested seam. Keeping this in the pure engine (no
--- mcphub, no MCP) makes it unit-testable in isolation under
--- `tests/edit/`.
---
--- ## Why U+FFFD rather than escaping or erroring
---
---   * Erroring would turn a cosmetic content-echo problem into a hard
---     tool failure — the edit itself may have succeeded, and refusing to
---     report that is worse than a `�` in a context snippet.
---   * Emitting `\uFFFD`-style escapes is what a strict encoder would do,
---     but we don't control `vim.json.encode`'s escaping; scrubbing the
---     input to already-valid UTF-8 is the robust, encoder-agnostic move.
---   * U+FFFD is the standard "this byte was undecodable" sentinel, so
---     the LLM sees a clear, conventional marker rather than silently
---     dropped bytes.
---
--- @module "nvu.edit.json"

local REPLACEMENT = '\239\191\189' -- EF BF BD

--- Scrub a string to well-formed UTF-8.
---
--- Walks the string byte-by-byte, validating each UTF-8 sequence against
--- the Unicode well-formedness rules (RFC 3629 / the Unicode "Table 3-7"
--- byte-sequence constraints). A valid sequence is copied verbatim; any
--- byte that cannot begin or continue a valid sequence is replaced by a
--- single U+FFFD and scanning resumes at the next byte.
---
--- The validation rejects, and therefore replaces:
---   * stray continuation bytes (0x80–0xBF with no lead byte),
---   * lead bytes 0xC0/0xC1 (only produce overlong 2-byte forms),
---   * overlong 3-byte forms (0xE0 with a second byte < 0xA0),
---   * **surrogate encodings** (0xED with a second byte >= 0xA0 → the
---     U+D800–U+DFFF range) — the specific class that trips strict JSON
---     parsers downstream,
---   * overlong / out-of-range 4-byte forms (0xF0 < 0x90; 0xF4 > 0x8F;
---     lead bytes 0xF5–0xFF),
---   * truncated sequences (a valid lead byte with too few following
---     continuation bytes before end-of-string).
