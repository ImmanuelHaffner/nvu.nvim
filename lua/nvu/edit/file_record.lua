--- nvu.edit.file_record — canonical in-memory representation of a file
--- being read by the planner.
---
--- A FileRecord is the input shape every anchor resolver expects:
---
---   {
---     path      = "/abs/path/lua/foo.lua",  -- absolute, normalised via `:p`
---     content   = "<raw bytes as a single Lua string>",
---     offsets   = { 1, 42, 117, ... },  -- 1-based; offsets[i] = first byte of line i
---     n_lines   = N,
---     bufnr     = 42,                  -- buffer the content was sourced from
---     endofline = true,                -- `:set endofline` for that buffer (affects EOL normalisation)
---   }
---
--- The string is canonical (multi-line `unique_text` matches need cross-line
--- scanning); offsets give O(1) line→byte slicing and O(log n) byte→line
--- translation.
---
--- ## Buffer-first reads
---
--- `M.read(path)` always sources content from a Neovim buffer. If a buffer
--- exists for the path (regardless of whether it's modified), that buffer is
--- the source. Otherwise the path is loaded into a fresh buffer via
--- `bufadd` + `bufload`. Reasons:
---
---   * Modified buffers carry unsaved changes the user is staring at. Reading
---     disk while ignoring them would lie to the LLM about the file's current
---     state. The fingerprint must be computed over what the LLM sees.
---   * mcphub's `EditUI` (which our applier reuses) operates on buffers. Using
---     buffers throughout means one consistent source of truth across read,
---     anchor resolution, and apply.
---   * `nvim_buf_get_lines` returns lines already split — no `string.gmatch`
---     pass, no encoding ambiguity. Fast for already-loaded buffers (memory)
---     and correct (it sees whatever Neovim has decoded, including BOM strip
---     and EOL conversion).
---
--- ## EOL normalisation
---
--- `nvim_buf_get_lines` strips line terminators. We rebuild `content` as
--- `table.concat(lines, '\n')` and append a final `\n` iff
--- `vim.bo[bufnr].endofline` is set (the default for files ending in `\n` on
--- disk). The `endofline` flag is captured in the record so the planner's
--- re-hash at apply time uses the same normalisation. Other newline
--- conventions (`\r\n`, `\r`) are out of scope for MVP — Neovim's
--- `'fileformat'` option already normalises these on load.
---
--- @module "nvu.edit.file_record"

local M = {}

--- A canonical file record.
--- @class nvu.edit.FileRecord
--- @field path      string                 Absolute path (via `fnamemodify(':p')`).
--- @field content   string                 Raw bytes of the file as a single Lua string (EOL-normalised, see module doc).
--- @field offsets   integer[]              1-based; offsets[i] = first byte of line i. Always has at least { 1 }.
--- @field n_lines   integer                Number of lines in `content`. Derived from `#offsets`.
--- @field bufnr     integer                Buffer number the content was sourced from.
--- @field endofline boolean                Captured `vim.bo[bufnr].endofline` at read time.

--- Build the line-start offsets array for a string.
---
--- Convention: `offsets[i]` is the byte position (1-based) where line `i`
--- begins. The line-terminator `\n` is considered to belong to the line it
--- terminates, NOT to start a new (phantom) line. Consequently:
---
---   ""              → {}             (0 lines)
---   "\n"            → {1}            (1 empty line)
---   "foo"           → {1}            (1 line, no trailing newline)
---   "foo\n"         → {1}            (1 line, trailing newline conventional)
---   "foo\nbar"      → {1, 5}         (2 lines, last unterminated)
---   "foo\nbar\n"    → {1, 5}         (2 lines, both terminated)
---   "foo\n\n"       → {1, 5}         (2 lines, second empty)
---
--- The `pos = i + 1` step at the bottom of the loop may push `pos` one past
--- `#content` when the last byte of the file is a `\n`. Lua's `string.find`
--- treats `init > #s` as a guaranteed no-match (returns nil), so this is safe
--- and the loop terminates naturally on the next iteration.
---
--- @param content string
--- @return integer[]
function M.build_offsets(content)
    if content == '' then return {} end
    local offsets = { 1 }
    local pos = 1
    local n = #content
    while true do
        local i = content:find('\n', pos, true)
        if not i then break end
        -- A '\n' at the very last byte terminates the line it sits on; it
        -- does NOT open a new (phantom) line. Only register the next-line
        -- offset if there's actually content after the newline.
        if i < n then
            table.insert(offsets, i + 1)
        end
        pos = i + 1
    end
    return offsets
end

--- Reconstruct file content from a buffer's lines, applying EOL normalisation.
---
--- `nvim_buf_get_lines` returns lines without their `\n` terminators. We
--- join with `\n` and append a final `\n` iff `endofline` is set (the
--- default — meaning the file ends with a newline on disk). The same
--- routine runs at read time and at planner-rehash time, so the hash is
--- stable across the read → apply window for unchanged buffers.

--- assigns. Fresh buffers are `bufload`ed (which reads from disk through
--- Neovim's normal load pipeline — encoding, BOM, `'fileformat'`). Pre-checks
