--- mcphub adapter for the `nvu.edit` engine.
---
--- Registers two tools on mcphub's existing `neovim` native server via
--- `mcphub.add_tool("neovim", …)`:
---
---   * `neovim__apply_edit`              — structured batch edits
---   * `neovim__read_with_fingerprint`   — read + baseline-fingerprint emission
---
--- These are intended to ship together. `apply_edit` requires every op
--- to carry a `baseline_fingerprint` field; the only legitimate source
--- of those fingerprints is `read_with_fingerprint`. Once both are
--- registered, the user should disable the legacy `neovim__read_file`
--- tool from mcphub's config — required fingerprints make any other
--- read path a footgun.
---
--- This is the *only* file in `nvu.nvim` that imports `mcphub`; the
--- engines themselves (`nvu.edit`, `nvu.edit.read`) stay pure Lua and
--- unit-testable in isolation.
---
--- This file is intended to be `require`d from the user's Neovim config
--- *after* `mcphub.setup{}` has run. Side effect: registers both tools.

local apply_edit_description = [[
Apply a batch of structured edits to existing files. Use this for editing *inside* existing files; for file create / delete / rename use `neovim__write_file`, `neovim__delete_items`, `neovim__move_item`.

Failures are plan-atomic: if any op fails to resolve, no buffer is touched and the response lists every problem with candidates and a hint — no fuzzy guessing, no silent wrong-location edits. Otherwise the user reviews each hunk and accepts or rejects it; per-op outcomes come back in `applied[]` / `rejected[]`.

Each op has a `kind`, a `path`, a `baseline_fingerprint` (from `neovim__read_with_fingerprint`; a mismatch means the file changed under you and the op is refused), and an `anchor`.

ANCHORS locate by `line_range` (1-based inclusive `start`/`end`) or `unique_text` (a verbatim substring, which may span several lines, that must match exactly once unless `occurrence` selects `{nth}` or `all`). A base anchor resolves to a span of whole line(s) `[S..E]`.

The anchor plays one of two roles, depending on the op:

  * For `replace_range` and `delete_range` the anchor IS the edit extent. The op acts on exactly the line(s) `[S..E]` it resolves to and never expands to the surrounding block: anchoring on the first line of a paragraph, function, or list edits only that one line. To act on a whole block the anchor must cover all of its lines (a `line_range` spanning them, or a `unique_text` matching the entire block).
  * For `insert` the anchor must be wrapped in a positional MODIFIER that turns the span into an insertion position; the span's own line(s) are left unchanged and `content` is placed at that position.

MODIFIERS turn a location into an insertion seam. The seam is named directly, never derived by counting:

  * `before` → just above a base anchor's span (before its first line).
  * `after`  → just below a base anchor's span (after its last line).
  * `between` → at the seam between two adjacent texts you name as `before_text` and `after_text`. The two are matched as one contiguous block (`before_text` then `after_text` on consecutive lines), so their CONCATENATION must be unique — neither side need be unique alone — and the seam falls at the join.

`before`/`after` wrap a base anchor in `of` and pin to one of its OUTER edges; the span exists only to be unique. Use them when all the context you need to identify the location sits on one side of the seam: put that context in the span and insert `before` it or `after` it.

`between` is for when the context that makes the location unique STRADDLES the seam — some existing lines before the insertion point and the disambiguating line(s) after it (or vice versa). You show the seam by splitting the existing text into the part before it (`before_text`) and the part after it (`after_text`); the engine inserts exactly at that cut. These are DESCRIPTIVE slices of the file framing the seam, not directions for placing content. This is the only way to keep both-sides context in the match while still inserting in the middle of it. Example: to insert after `bar()` where `foo()`/`bar()` is not unique but `foo()`/`bar()`/`baz()` is, use `before_text: "foo()\nbar()"`, `after_text: "baz()"`.

These ops are line-granular: anchors resolve to whole lines, and edits add, replace, or remove whole lines. A `unique_text` match selects the whole line(s) it falls on, never just the matched substring — so for `replace_range`, `content` must be the complete new line(s), including any unchanged text on the matched line(s).

CONTENT for replace/insert is supplied as exactly one of `content` (inline, for short text) or `content_ref` → `contents[label]` (for multi-line bulk). `delete_range` takes no content.

NEWLINE OWNERSHIP: a newline separates lines; it is never part of a line's own text.
This has three consequences you must respect, because getting them wrong corrupts the file silently or is rejected outright.
(1) `content` is the body of the line(s) only — never start or end it with `\n`.
A leading or trailing `\n` in `content` is spliced in as a spurious blank line (leading -> a blank line before your text, trailing -> a blank line after), so the tool REJECTS it.
Interior newlines are fine and expected for multi-line content.
To add a real blank line, make it an interior line between non-empty lines.
(2) A `unique_text` anchor must NOT start with `\n`: a leading newline belongs to the PREVIOUS line, so it silently pulls that line into the matched range and your edit would clobber one line too many — this is REJECTED.
A TRAILING `\n` in `unique_text`, by contrast, is allowed and useful: it anchors to end-of-line, so `text: "foo\n"` matches the whole line `foo` but not the `foo` inside `foobar`.
(3) For `between`, the engine supplies the seam newline itself (it matches `before_text` + newline + `after_text`), so `before_text` must not end with `\n` and `after_text` must not start with one.

BATCH ORDERING: every op in one call is resolved against the SAME original file (the snapshot your `baseline_fingerprint` pins), then all are applied together with line-shift bookkeeping handled internally. Line numbers always refer to that original file: an earlier op that grows or shrinks the file does NOT move the numbers a later op should use. Submit ops in any order with original line numbers throughout; do NOT pre-sort ops descending or hand-adjust line numbers to compensate for other edits in the batch.
To remove ADJACENT lines, use ONE `delete_range` spanning them rather than several single-line deletes: the review step needs a one-line gap between the regions two ops touch, so back-to-back deletes in one batch are refused with `range_conflict` even though their line ranges do not overlap.

INDENTATION: `replace_range` and `insert` REQUIRE an explicit `indent`, because the engine cannot tell whether you already indented `content` yourself. Choose by how you wrote `content`. `indent: "match_anchor"` prepends the anchor span's leading whitespace (taken from its first line) to each content line, so write `content` at column 0 — its internal relative indentation is preserved while the block is shifted to the anchor's depth, and blank lines stay blank. `indent: "preserve"` inserts `content` byte-for-byte, so write the full leading whitespace yourself; this is also the right choice for a multi-line `replace_range` over a mixed-indent region where a single prefix does not fit every line. Do not combine the two by hand: choosing `match_anchor` AND indenting `content` yourself doubles the indentation, the most common failure here.

EXAMPLES (anchors abbreviated; each op also needs `path` and `baseline_fingerprint`):

  Replace lines 10–12, letting the engine indent (content written at column 0):
    { kind: replace_range,
      anchor: { by: line_range, start: 10, end: 12 },
      content: "...", indent: "match_anchor" }

  Rewrite one whole line located by its text (content is the WHOLE line, already indented — so preserve it verbatim):
    { kind: replace_range,
      anchor: { by: unique_text, text: "  let total = subtotal" },
      content: "  let total = subtotal + tax", indent: "preserve" }

  Insert a guard after a function's opening line, where the signature alone is not unique but signature + first body line is. The disambiguating line sits after the seam, so use `between`: `before_text` is the opening line(s), `after_text` is the line the insert must precede. Content already indented, so preserve:
    { kind: insert,
      anchor: { by: between,
                before_text: "function foo(x)",
                after_text: "    if x > 42 then" },
      content: "    if x == nil then return 'dang' end", indent: "preserve" }

  Insert a line above a uniquely-identified line, written at column 0 for the engine to indent:
    { kind: insert,
      anchor: { by: before, of: { by: unique_text, text: "return result" } },
      content: "result = normalize(result)", indent: "match_anchor" }

  Delete a block by line range (no content, no indent):
    { kind: delete_range, anchor: { by: line_range, start: 40, end: 47 } }

  Two edits in one call, original line numbers, any order:
    [ { kind: replace_range, anchor: { by: line_range, start: 3, end: 3 },
        content: "...", indent: "match_anchor" },
      { kind: insert, anchor: { by: after,
          of: { by: line_range, start: 20, end: 20 } },
        content: "...", indent: "preserve" } ]

local read_description = [[
Read a file and receive its content together with an opaque baseline fingerprint. The fingerprint is the LLM's receipt: pass it back verbatim in the `baseline_fingerprint` field of every `apply_edit` op against this file. The planner re-computes the fingerprint at apply time and refuses the batch on mismatch (`stale_fingerprint`), closing the race where the file mutates between read and edit.

This is the **canonical** read path for text files. Prefer it over `execute_command` + `sed`/`head`/`awk`/`cat` even for verification reads after an edit: those bypass the fingerprint binding and the buffer-first semantics, and route through the spill guard. Treat the fingerprint as opaque; do not parse or regenerate it.

Optional range projection: pass `start_line` and/or `end_line` (1-based, inclusive) to restrict the returned `content` to a slice of the file. Defaults: `start_line = 1`, `end_line = total_lines`. `end_line` past EOF clamps silently; `start_line` past EOF refuses with `start_after_eof` (your view of the file is stale). The `baseline_fingerprint` is always whole-file regardless of the range — do not assume a partial read pins only the part you read.

Returns on success: { status: "ok", path, content, baseline_fingerprint, start_line, end_line, returned_lines, total_lines }
On error: { status: "failed", summary, failed: [{ reason, path, message, hint, ... }] }

-- Notify two distinct audiences that the `neovim` server's tool list grew.
--
-- `mcphub.add_tool` mutates the native server's `capabilities.tools` array
-- directly and does NOT fire any event. Two downstream consumers need
-- nudges on two separate buses:
--
--   1. The mcphub→CodeCompanion bridge subscribes via `mcphub.on(...)` →
--      `State:add_event_listener` and only re-enumerates tools on the
--      `tool_list_changed` event. Without this emit, our two new tools
--      live on the server but never surface in CodeCompanion's `@`-tool
--      completion. This is *not* the same channel as `mcphub.utils.fire`,
--      which dispatches `User` autocmds — CC's bridge doesn't listen
--      there. Don't "simplify" to `mcphub.fire`.
--
--   2. The mcphub `:MCPHub` UI subscribes via `State:subscribe` on
--      `{ "ui", "server", ... }` and re-renders when `State:notify_subscribers`
--      reports a change to `server_state`. `State:update` would seem the
--      natural choice, but it deep-equals the partial against the current
--      state, and since `add_tool` already mutated the same table in-place,
--      the deep-equal check returns "no change" and nothing fires.
--      `notify_subscribers` is the public-shaped primitive `State:update`
--      itself uses; calling it directly skips the false-negative guard.
--
-- Both nudges are wrapped in pcall: `mcphub.state` is internal API. If its
-- layout changes (e.g. State becomes per-hub, methods get renamed) we
-- degrade to a warning rather than break adapter loading.
--
-- Gated on at least one successful add_tool — emitting with no real
-- capability change just triggers a no-op refresh storm.
