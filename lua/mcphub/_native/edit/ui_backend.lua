--- mcphub._native.edit.ui_backend — `drive_file` callback driven by mcphub's `EditUI`.
---
--- ## Why this file lives here, not under `lua/nvu/edit/`
---
--- The pure engine in `lua/nvu/edit/` deliberately does not import anything
--- from mcphub. This file is the bridge: it implements the `drive_file`
--- shape documented in `nvu.edit.applier.apply_plan` against mcphub's
--- `EditUI`. Any caller wanting a non-mcphub backend (CLI batch mode, a
--- synthetic test driver, etc.) can write a sibling that conforms to the
--- same call contract.
---
--- ## What we reuse from mcphub
---
--- Only `EditUI` itself — not `EditSession`, `DiffParser`, or
--- `BlockLocator`. Those comprise the SEARCH/REPLACE protocol layer we're
--- replacing. `EditUI` is the reusable piece: open file → apply changes →
--- per-hunk review (when interactive) → write. We feed it pre-resolved
--- `LocatedBlock`s constructed from the applier's `Block[]` request.
---
--- See the spelunking notes in `/memories/parked-sessions/nvu-edit-tool.md`
--- for the load-bearing observations about `EditUI`'s shape: `interactive`
--- propagation, `completed_hunks` snapshot timing, `cleanup()` nils state,
--- `get_summary` is async, `_apply_all_changes` sorts ascending internally.
---
--- @module "mcphub._native.edit.ui_backend"

local M = {}

--- Widen a zero-width-range or empty-replace block by borrowing one
--- neighbouring buffer line, so that the `LocatedBlock` handed to mcphub's
--- `EditUI` has both `found_lines` and `replace_lines` non-empty.
---
--- ## Why this exists
---
--- `EditUI._generate_hunk_blocks` constructs the inputs to `vim.diff` as
--- `table.concat(lines, "\n") .. "\n"`. For an empty list this is `"\n"`,
--- which `vim.diff` interprets as a **single empty line**, not zero lines.
--- That breaks two ways:
---
---   * **Pure deletion** (our `delete_range`, `replace_lines == []`):
---     `vim.diff` reports `new_count = 1` instead of `0`. The hunk is
---     classified as `"change"` instead of `"deletion"`; the "change"
---     branch in `_highlight_hunk_block` then calls `nvim_buf_set_extmark`
---     with an `end_row` past the (now-shorter) buffer, crashing with
---     `E5111: Invalid 'end_row': out of range`.
---
---   * **Pure insertion** (zero-width range, `found_lines == []`):
---     `vim.diff` reports `old_count = 1` instead of `0`. Hunk becomes
---     `"change"` instead of `"addition"`; the highlighted row is off by
---     one. (Doesn't crash, but mishighlights.)
---
--- The principled fix is in mcphub. The pragmatic fix is here: synthesise
--- a non-zero-width pair by borrowing one adjacent buffer line. `vim.diff`
--- then naturally splits the resulting pair into a clean addition or
--- deletion sub-hunk (the borrowed line becomes context), so the user
--- sees correct highlighting and `EditUI`'s apply path produces the
--- byte-identical buffer state.
---
--- ## Borrowing strategy
---
---   * **Pure insert** (`range = { N, N-1 }`, `replace_lines = R`):
---     borrow line `N` if it exists, else line `N-1` (insert-at-EOF case).
---     Widen the range to cover the borrowed line and append/prepend it
---     to `replace_lines` so the net buffer effect is unchanged.
---
---   * **Pure delete** (`range = { S, E }`, `replace_lines = []`):
---     borrow line `E+1` if it exists, else line `S-1` (delete-to-EOF).
---     Widen the range to cover the borrowed line; `replace_lines`
---     becomes `[borrowed]`.
---
---   * **Pure delete of the entire buffer** (`S == 1`, `E == #buf`,
---     `replace_lines = []`): no line to borrow on either side. Returns
---     `nil`; the caller must apply this block via a direct
---     `nvim_buf_set_lines` path instead of going through `EditUI`. (Not
---     reachable from the MVP anchor set in practice — would require a
---     user-issued `delete_range` covering all lines.)
---
--- @param bufnr integer
--- @param block nvu.edit.applier.Block
--- @return nvu.edit.applier.Block?  Widened block, or `nil` for the
---     degenerate whole-file-delete case.

--- Detect inter-block range conflicts that the planner could not have
--- caught because they only exist after `widen_for_editui` has run.
---
--- ## The conflict shape
---
--- Two blocks' **post-widen** effective ranges overlap. The planner saw
--- the pre-widen ranges (which were non-overlapping by its own
--- conflict-detection guarantee), so it had no chance to refuse the
--- batch. EditUI's `_apply_all_changes` would then apply both blocks in
--- whatever order Lua's non-stable `table.sort` picks for ties, with
--- the later block clobbering the earlier one's changes. Result: silent
--- wrong output and a dishonest `applied` response — the very failure
--- mode the structured-anchor design exists to eliminate.
---
--- The refusal is at-file granularity, not at-batch: a batch with two
--- files where only one has a collision still gets the other file
--- processed. Each colliding op surfaces as `failed[]` with reason
--- `range_conflict` and the conflicting op's index in
--- `conflicting_op_indices` so the LLM can re-issue the batch in a way
--- the applier can handle (e.g. split into two batches).
---
--- ## What counts as a collision
---
---   * Two effective ranges overlap on any line.
---   * A block's effective range was `nil` (widening would have refused
---     it — whole-file delete with no neighbour). Reported as a self-
---     collision with `conflicting_op_indices = {}`.
---

--- @param blocks nvu.edit.applier.Block[]
--- @return table[]  failures   One entry per affected op (each side of every
---                  detected conflict appears once). Empty list means no

--- out a `setup` API for one knob would be premature; once we have
--- more configuration to expose, this folds in cleanly.

--- Compute the wait-time ceiling for a buffer given its attached LSP
--- clients. Pure function: takes a client list rather than calling
--- `vim.lsp.get_clients` itself, so tests can drive it with synthetic
--- client tables.
---
--- ## Resolution rule
---
---   * Empty client list → 0 ms (no LSP, no diagnostics to wait for).
---   * Otherwise → the **maximum** of `wait_table[client.name]` (or
---     `default_ms` when unknown) across all clients. A buffer with
---     multiple LSPs waits long enough for every one of them.
---
--- @param clients    { name: string }[]   typically from `vim.lsp.get_clients`
--- @param wait_table table<string, integer>
--- @param default_ms integer
--- @return integer

--- Map a `vim.diagnostic.severity` integer enum to our stable
--- lowercase string convention.
---
--- The numeric enum (`ERROR=1, WARN=2, INFO=3, HINT=4`) is the canonical
--- form inside Neovim, but it's an awkward shape on the wire — LLMs read
--- "warn" more reliably than "2", and the integer mapping is a Neovim
--- implementation detail the response shouldn't leak.

}

--- Collect diagnostics from a buffer, filter by severity, and translate
--- to our `nvu.edit.Diagnostic` shape.
---
--- ## When to call this
---
--- Call inside `EditUI:get_summary`'s callback. By the time the callback
--- fires, mcphub has already deferred long enough for the LSP server's
--- post-`:write` diagnostics to arrive (gated by the
--- `wait_for_diagnostics` config we pass). Querying earlier would risk
--- reading a stale set; querying later wastes time.
---
--- ## Position conventions
---
--- `vim.diagnostic.Diagnostic` uses 0-based positions exclusively. We
--- translate every field to 1-based to match the rest of the response
--- shape (line ranges in `applied[]` / `rejected[]` are 1-based
--- inclusive everywhere).
---
--- ## Severity filter
---
--- `min_severity` is a `vim.diagnostic.severity` enum value. Diagnostics
--- with a numerically lower-or-equal severity (i.e. equal-or-more-severe)
--- are kept. Default `WARN` filters out `HINT` and `INFO`, which are
--- typically too chatty for LLM consumption. To get everything, pass
--- `vim.diagnostic.severity.HINT`.

--- @param min_severity integer  vim.diagnostic.severity enum value
--- @return nvu.edit.Diagnostic[]
