--- Synthetic `drive_file` implementations for applier specs.
---
--- The real driver — `mcphub._native.edit.ui_backend.drive_file` — depends on
--- mcphub's `EditUI` and is callback-driven through `vim.schedule`, making
--- it awkward for unit tests of the applier. The applier's `drive_file`
--- contract (see `nvu.edit.applier.apply_plan`) is small enough that we can
--- supply minimal synthetic implementations here:
---
---   * `accept_all` — applies every block to the buffer, writes the file,
---     and reports every block as `'accepted'`. Mirrors the headless
---     `interactive = false` path of `EditUI`.
---   * `reject_all` — does not touch the buffer, does not write, and reports
---     every block as `'rejected'`. Mirrors what a user would see after
---     pressing `gr` on every hunk in interactive `EditUI`.
---   * `make_selective(decisions)` — factory that returns a driver applying
---     only the accepted blocks. Caller supplies `{ [block_id|op_index] =
---     'accept'|'reject' }`. The mixed acceptance path is where the
---     applier's `classify_outcome` does its most interesting work.
---   * `cancel_at(file_path)` — factory returning a driver that reports
---     `status = 'cancelled'` for one specific file. Useful for testing
---     the `not_attempted` cascade.
---
--- ## Scope of these mocks
---
--- They test the **applier's reaction** to outcome shapes, not mcphub's
--- production of those outcomes. We rely on the real-EditUI smoke (run
--- manually) to verify mcphub honours the `LocatedBlock` contract on the
--- reject path. If you suspect a regression in mcphub's `_reject_current_hunk`
--- against our shape, that's a smoke-test concern, not a unit-test one.
---
--- These drivers are **non-interactive** by construction: they apply blocks
--- synchronously inside their request handler, then invoke `file_cb` via
--- `vim.schedule` so that the applier's sequencing — which assumes the
--- callback fires from a scheduled context — sees the same timing it
--- gets from the production driver.

--- Apply a list of blocks to a buffer in bottom-up order. Within a single

--- blocks' line numbers are unaffected by later mutations — no offset

--- Build a driver that applies blocks selectively based on caller decisions.
---
--- `decisions` maps either `block_id` (string) or `op_index` (integer) to
--- the string `'accept'`, `'reject'`, or `'partial'`. A block missing from
--- the map defaults to `'accept'` so omitting an entry behaves like
--- `accept_all` for that block.
---
--- Both keying flavours coexist — `block_id` takes precedence when both
--- are present. The op_index form is convenient for one-range-per-op
--- batches (the common case) where the block_id `opN_r1` is just noise.
---
--- ## Status semantics
---
---   * `'accept'`   → apply the block, mark `per_block[block_id] = 'accepted'`.
---   * `'reject'`   → do not apply, mark `per_block[block_id] = 'rejected'`.
---   * `'partial'`  → do not apply, mark `per_block[block_id] = 'partial'`.
---                     The applier surfaces this as `rejected[]` with
---                     `reason = 'partially_rejected'`. Useful for testing
---                     the multi-hunk-per-block partial-acceptance path
---                     without actually splitting into sub-hunks.
